# 📖 Introduction

## ❓ Problem Statement
There are huge number of people who visit shops to get print of some sort, it could be admit cards, documents, project files, etc. and
to do so they have to physically go to the store of their choice, get in queue and wait for their file to be printed. Hence making the process
cumbersome and time taking. Even though alternatives exist, like using Whatsapp to do so, but it requires trust from the shopkeeper and is not dedicated
for this purpose. Hence indicating the need for a dedicated product to solve this problem.
